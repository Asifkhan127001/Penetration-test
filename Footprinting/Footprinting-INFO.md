## What is DNS Footprinting?
DNS Footprinting is a technique that is used by an attacker to gather DNS information about the target system. DNS Footprinting allows the attacker to obtain information about the DNS Zone Data, Domain Names, Computer Name, Network related information etc..

## Different kinds of information that can be gathered from Footprinting are as follows:

1. The operating system of the target machine
2. Firewall
3. IP address
4. Network Map
5. Security configurations of the target machine
6. Email id, password
7. Server configurations
8. URLs
9. VPN


## Sources are as follows:

1. Social Media: Most people have the tendency to release most of their information online. Hackers use this sensitive information as a big deal. They may create a fake account for looking real to be added as friends or to follow someone’s account for grabbing their information. 
2. JOB websites: Organizations share some confidential data on many JOB websites like monsterindia.com. For example, a company posted on a website: “Job Opening for Lighttpd 2.0 Server Administrator”. From this, information can be gathered that an organization uses the Lighttpd web server of version 2.0. 
3. Google: Search engines such as Google have the ability to perform more powerful searches than one can think and one had gone through. It can be used by hackers and attackers to do something that has been termed Google hacking. Basic search techniques combined with advanced operators can do great damage. Server operators exist like “inurl:”,”allinurl:”,”filetype:”, etc. 

For example, devices connected to the Internet can be found. A search string such as inurl: “ViewerFrame?Mode=” will find public web cameras. “The “link:” search operator that Google used to have, has been turned off by now (2017)”. 

Google can be used to uncover many pieces of sensitive information that shouldn’t be revealed. A term even exists for the people who blindly post this information on the internet, they are called “Google Dorks”. 

4. Social Engineering: There are various techniques that fall in this category. A few of them are: 
5. Competitive Intelligence : Competitive Intelligence gathering is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and verifying, and using the information about your competitors from sources such as the internet. Monitoring web traffic etc.
6. DNS Footprinting : Attacker can gather DNS information to determine key hosts in the network
7. Email Footprinting : Can get recipient's IP address, Geolocation, Email Received and Read, Read Duration, Proxy Detection, Links, OS and Browser info, Forward Email
8. Eavesdropping: The attacker tries to record the personal conversation of the target victim with someone that’s being held over communication mediums like the Telephone.
9. Shoulder Surfing: In this technique, Attacker tries to catch the personal information like email id, password, etc; of the victim by looking over the victim’s shoulder while the same is entering(typing/writing) his/her personal details for some work. 
10. Archive.org: The Archived version refers to the older version of the website which existed a time before and many features of the website have been changed. archive.org is a website that collects snapshots of all the websites at a regular interval of time. This site can be used to get some information that does not exist now but existed before on the site. 
11. An Organization’s Website: It’s the best place to begin for an attacker. If an attacker wants to look for open-source information, which is information freely provided to clients, customers, or the general public then simply the best option is: “ORGANISATION’s WEBSITE”. 
12. Using Neo Trace: NeoTrace is a powerful tool for getting path information. The graphical display displays the route between you and the remote site, including all intermediate nodes and their information. NeoTrace is a well-known GUI route tracer program. Along with a graphical route, it also displays information on each node such as IP address, contact information, and location. 
13. Who is: This is a website that serves a good purpose for Hackers. Through this website information about the domain name, email-id, domain owner, etc; a website can be traced. Basically, this serves as a way for Website Footprinting.
14. GITHUB: Github IT service management company overall 99% company project in github so github is best option to find information like any company



## Some of the main records that are important in DNS Footprinting are as follows:

1. A = A record is an address mapping record, also known as a DNS host record.

2. MX = The mail server record specifies an SMTP email server 

3. NS = 	It specifies the authoritative Name Server.

4. CNMAE = Conical Name record, alias record used to alias a hostname to another hostname

5. SOA = Start of Authority is the authoritative Name server for the current DNS zone.

6. PTR = Pointer records, It allows a DNS resolver to provide an IP address and receive a hostname

7. TXT = Text Record, It contains machine-readable data such as DKIM.

8. HINFO = Host information record includes CPU type and OS

9. SRV = Service Records
