DNS Footprinting is a technique that is used by an attacker to gather DNS information about the target system. DNS Footprinting allows the attacker to obtain information about the DNS Zone Data, Domain Names, Computer Name, Network related information etc..

## Different kinds of information that can be gathered from Footprinting are as follows:

1. The operating system of the target machine
2. Firewall
3. IP address
4. Network Map
5. Security configurations of the target machine
6. Email id, password
7. Server configurations
8. URLs
9. VPN

## Some of the main records that are important in DNS Footprinting are as follows:

A = A record is an address mapping record, also known as a DNS host record.

MX = The mail server record specifies an SMTP email server 

NS = 	It specifies the authoritative Name Server.

CNMAE = Conical Name record, alias record used to alias a hostname to another hostname
