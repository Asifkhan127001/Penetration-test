## 1. IP

An Internet Protocol address is a numerical label such as 192.0.2.1 that is connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address serves two main functions: network interface identification and location addressing.




## 2. SUBNET

A subnetwork or subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network. The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting. Computers that belong to the same subnet are addressed with an identical most-significant bit-group in their IP addresses





## 3. LIVE IP

Find how many host is live in network 




## 4. PORTS 

In computer networking, a port is a number assigned to uniquely identify a connection endpoint and to direct data to a specific service. At the software level, within an operating system, a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or a type of network service. 




## 5. SERVICE

A port is a virtual point where network connections start and end. Ports are software-based and managed by a computer's operating system. Each port is associated with a specific process or service.




## 6. SERVICE VERSION 

Service means like software every software version so you find the service version and use the service version and find exploit 





## 7. OS 

An operating system is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs






## 8. IDS vs IPS

I. IDS 

An intrusion detection system is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. Any intrusion activity or violation is typically reported either to an administrator or collected centrally using a security information and event management system.

II. IPS 

The network intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) appliance market is composed of stand-alone physical and virtual appliances that inspect defined network traffic either on-premises or in the cloud.
