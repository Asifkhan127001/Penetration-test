# Kernel Exploits 

## The Kernel exploit methodology is simple;

1. Identify the kernel version
2. Search and find an exploit code for the kernel version of the target system
3. Run the exploit 


Research sources:

1. Based on your findings, you can use Google to search for an existing exploit code.
2. Sources such as https://www.linuxkernelcves.com/cves can also be useful.
3. Another alternative would be to use a script like LES (Linux Exploit Suggester) but remember that these tools can generate false positives (report a kernel vulnerability that does not affect the target system) or false negatives (not report any kernel vulnerabilities although the kernel is vulnerable).
